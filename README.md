# TimeTracker

Simple Java application for tracking the working time each day.

Ever wondered how long you are working? Start TimeTracker and push the button to activate time tracking. See how long you need to work today to get your eight hours of work. See how long you need to work this week to get your 40 hours of work. Nice progress bar. Much wow.
